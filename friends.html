      Steven doesn't have lots of friends but he does make friends.Im short he
      only knows people and that's all.You might think you are friends with him
      but in reality you are lying to yourself.Below we have a collection of
      some of his friends from school and home.Don't get me wrong if you are not
      here its not cuz your are not friends with him but he just wasn't thinking
      of you at that moment.No hard feelings?
